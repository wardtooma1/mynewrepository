    <p>In 1769 the first steam-powered automobile capable of transporting people was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot.[2
    In 1769 the first steam-powered automobile capable of transporting people was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot.[2]
In 1807 Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz designed the first hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine.[3] In 1813 he built a car 6 metres (20 ft) long and weighing over 1 metric ton (0.98 long tons; 1.1 short tons).[3]
Between 1832 and 1839, Robert Anderson built the first electric-powered carriage in Scotland.[1]
In 1864 Siegfried Marcus built the first gasoline powered internal combustion engine. In 1870 he placed it on a pushcart making it the first four wheeled gasoline-powered vehicle.[4] He built four more combustion-engine cars over a 10-to-15-year span that influenced later cars. Marcus created the two-cycle combustion engine. The car's second version in 1880 introduced a four-cycle, gasoline-powered engine. It had an ingenious carburetor design, and magneto ignition. He created an additional two models further refining his design with steering, a clutch, and brakes. His second car is on display at the Technical Museum in Vienna. During his lifetime, he was honored as the originator of the motorcar. But his place in history was all but erased by the Nazis during World War II. Because Marcus was of Jewish descent, the Nazi propaganda office ordered his work to be destroyed, his name expunged from future textbooks, and his public memorials removed. They gave credit instead to Karl Benz.[5]
In 1885-1886, Karl Benz developed a petrol- or gasoline-powered automobile.[1] It was called the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. This is also considered to be the first "production" automobile.[1]
In 1886, Gottlieb Daimler built the first four-wheeled, four-stroke engine called the "Cannstatt-Daimler."[1]
In 1893, Charles Duryea and his brother J. Frank Duryea built the first successful gasoline-powered car with a two-stroke engine.[1] The two brothers set up the first American car manufacturing company.[1]
In 1895, George Baldwin Selden received the patent for the combined internal-combustion engine with a carriage.[1] He never produced the vehicle and only seldom collected royalties for using his patent.[1]
In 1908, Henry Ford began producing affordable, simple and reliable cars anyone could drive.</p>
<h2>Cars usage</h2>
<p>
    This is the period starts with the car made by Karl Benz in 1885.[7] There were earlier inventions that used mainly steam-power to move the vehicles but the Benz car was the first to use a gasoline powered internal combustion engine in what could be called an automobile.[7] The period goes up to the start of the production of Henry Ford's Model T.[7]
